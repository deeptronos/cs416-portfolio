# Computer Sound and Music Portfolio
### Catherine N. 2024 for Bart Massey's CS-416P/516-001 Fall 2024.

## Overview
The code and journaling for my work in Bart Massey's Computer Sound and Music course.

Programs and libraries I've written are available in the [`/code`](/code) directory.

I maintain an "engineering notebook"-style journal in [`/notebook.md`](/notebook.md).
