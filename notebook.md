## "Clipped" assignment
I decided to use Rust to complete this assignment. I made this decision because I have enjoyed working with Rust a great deal more than any other programming language during my Rust Web Dev class in the Spring, but I haven't yet had the opportunity to work with audio. I imagine that later work in this course will involve working with audio in real-time, and I'd like to be speaking a language as performant and system-level as Rust once we get there. This assignment provided a good opportunity to familiarize myself with a more abstracted version of the standard low-level Rust audio library, CPAL, in the form of Hound. Hound was super painless to work with and allowed me to get right to the details of implementing the assignment without worrying about the details of encoding/playback/WAV technicalities etc.
